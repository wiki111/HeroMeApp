        Your anger gives you great power. But if you Iet it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.
        Speak of the devil, and he shall appear. But no ordinary child, a child born in hell, forged
        from suffering, hardened by pain. Not a man from privilege. Do you feel in charge? I had a
        vision of a world without Batman. The Mob ground out a little profit and the police tried to
        shut them down one block at a time. And it was so boring. I\'ve had a change of heart. I
        don\'t want Mr Reese spoiling everything but why should I have all the fun? Let\'s give someone
        else a chance. If Coleman Reese isn\'t dead in 60 minutes then I blow up a hospital. How about
        a magic trick? I\'m gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da! Batman may have made the front
        page but Bruce Wayne got pushed to page eight. Do I really look like a guy with a plan? I hope
        you're not a member of the fire brigade. So you came back to die with your city! I just want
        my phone call. It's ends here. Let me get this straight. You think that your client, one of
        the wealthiest, most powerful men in the world is secretly a vigilante who spends his nights
        beating criminals to a pulp with his bare hands and your plan is to blackmail this person?
        Good luck. Are you so desperate to fight criminals that you lock yourself in to take them on
        one at a time ?</string>

        Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I\'m not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain\'s going to be? He\'s the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they\'re friends, like you and me! I should\'ve known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.

        On second thoughts, let\'s not go there. It is a silly place. You don\'t vote for kings. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.But you are dressed as oneâ€¦ I\'m not a witch. Burn her! And the hat. She's a witch! Shut up! Will you shut up?!What a strange person. Now, look here, my good man. Well, we did do the nose. Well, she turned me into a newt. Well, I got better. I am your king.

                .... And then, I just got to add this: There was a whole firestorm
        yesterday about Brooke being, you know, a part of our crew. And let me just
        say this ... this is all I\'m gonna say about it: Where there were four ...
        there are now three. Goodbye, Brooke, and good luck in your travels ...
        you\'re gonna need it ... badly... So .... Yeah, I didn\'t care about that
        vanity card. In fact, I went straight on with that one and just dispelled
        that one. No, you won\'t get high .... It\'s all good. It\'s all good, guys.
        Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic, no judgment. Yeah, why not?
        'Cause it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms.  The only thing I'm
        addicted to right now is winning. You know? This bootleg cult - you know,
        arrogantly referred to as 'Alcoholics Anonymous' - now supports a 5%
        success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math!  Yeah, why not? 'Cause
        it's just pure ... pure and complete gnarlyisms. 100%. You know, here's
        your first pee test. Next one goes in your mouth.
